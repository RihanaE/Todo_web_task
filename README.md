# Todo_web_task

This repository contains a simple todo web app built using TypeScript and React, with Bootstrap for styling. The app allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks.

##How to Run the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by navigating to the root directory and running the command:

    npm install

2. After installing the dependencies, start the development server by running the command:

    npm start

Once the server is up and running, you can access the app in your browser by visiting http://localhost:3000. If you have the app hosted on a different port, replace 3000 with the appropriate port number.
